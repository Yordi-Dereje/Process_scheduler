# Process Scheduler App
This is a simple app, implemented in cpp. that demonstrates various process scheduling algorithms. This gives users the opportunity to simulate different scheduling algorithms and observe the effects on execution.

## Features

- Supports the following scheduling algorithms:
  - First-come, First-served (FCFS)
  - Shortest Job First (SJF)
  - Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
  - Round Robin (RR)
  - Preemptive priority scheduling
  - Non preemptive priority scheduling

## Prerequisites
 - C++ compiler (GCC)

## Getting started
1. Clone this repository:
   ```git clone https://github.com/Yordi-Dereje/Process_scheduler.git```
2. Move into the directory:
   cd Process_scheduler
3. create the executable file using:
   gcc main.cpp -o main
4. Allow chmod executable access:
   chmod +x main
5. Execute the file:
   ./main

## Usage
This app provides a command-line interface for user interaction. The user should follow the on-screen instructions to simulate different scheduling algorithms and observe results
